# FireFox File Renamer
Renames the files downloaded from Course Page of VIT Academics

# Installation
Visit [main page](https://github.com/MrL1605/File-Renamer) and have a look at how to install extension.

# Working

Firefox does not provide access to prompt where we can set the file path. Therefore, I have used some unconventional methods described below.
    
    
- After clicking the link, File Renamer will verify if it is downloaded from academics page.
- If not it will ignore the file, else extract the file name from Url.
- Cancel the on going download.(You might see a failed file in Download Manager with full name)
- Download the file again with new shorter filename.
- Save it in the same location as old file was going to be stored.
